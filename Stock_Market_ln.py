st.write(""" An Introduction To The Stock Market:

The concept of the stock market is still alien to some. 
The level of awareness has increased tremendously in recent times, thanks to active promotion on the Internet and the rise of mobile applications that simplify the investment process. 
Despite the recent availability of such resources, there is no denying that such complex ideas are best understood when explained in simple terms, and that is exactly what this page wishes to accomplish: Your layman’s guide to the world of stock trading. 

Let us begin with a quintessential question: What is a stock? If an establishment (or simply, “company”) is in need of money, it makes sense for them to turn to people who wish to give them the capital they require, in exchange for an equal percentage of the company’s return. 
Imagine the ownership of a company is depicted as a pie, every investor is a “shareholder”, hence they own a small slice of this pie. 
And this “slice” is a share, a fraction of the stock. 
But ownership of a share doesn’t directly translate into ownership of a fraction of the company. 
If the company owns offices and warehouses, a shareholder doesn’t own a part of these assets. 
Shareholders merely own the shares that the company has issued, not their assets. 
This is called “equity ownership”, which is the basic principle to understanding stock trading

So, what is a stock market? It is essentially a “marketplace” for trading shares. 
There are various corporations in the world that seek capital to undertake projects and ventures. 
And the people who believe that they too can profit off of a company’s success involve themselves in the stock market. 
The stock market doesn’t restrict investors to only owning shares in one company, they can diversify their investments by investing their money in any number of companies from various backgrounds as per their wish. 
The number of shares that a company wishes to sell to investors is decided by the company. 
These “issued shares” are put up for sale, and interested investors purchase them. 

After purchasing, the investor can decide if they want to hold on to the share or sell their shares. 
The value of the share increases/ decreases depending on the current condition of the company’s performance. 
If the company launches a product which has a lot of positive publicity, chances of sales increase, which is directly proportional to increase in the value of the company. 

The stock market and stock trading are strictly regulated and centralised, meaning the governmental bodies hold the authority to implement laws to eliminate risk of malpractice. 
Hopefully, this introduction to the wonderful world of stock trading has been sufficient. 
Remember, understanding the working of the stock market and its nuances and intricacies is critical to achieve success. 

An industry as complex as the stock market is overloaded with technical terms which are instrumental in one’s success. 
Unfortunately, the vocabulary is often difficult for the layman to fully comprehend. 
Here’s a list of stock trading jargon which we believe is absolutely essential:
→ Agent - An agent is a “brokerage” firm that acts as a middleman between an investor and the stock market. 
They buy/ sell shares on the behalf of the investor, and they collect a small percentage of the returns as commission for their services.

→ “Bull Market” - Denotes a time of prosperity, when share prices are rising. 
Rising share prices mean that share owners can now sell their shares for a greater profit.

→ “Bear Market” - The antithesis to the Bull Market. 
It denotes a period when share prices start slumping from a high, this results in the share losing value.

→ “Blue Chip Stock” - Shares belonging to well established corporate giants (TCS, SBI, Coal India, etc). 
These shares are believed to be safer alternatives, since the chances of exponential loss are reduced.

→ Open/ Closing Price - The “opening price” of a stock refers to the value of a share when the market begins its operations for the day. 
The “closing price” of a stock refers to the value of a share when the market closes for the day. 
The prices fluctuate throughout the day and investors can trade when their shares reach their preferred value. 

→ Volume - As the name suggests, it is the term used to address the number of stocks traded within a time span (sold and bought).
